### Introduction
This project aims to manipulating the DOM by appending dynamically added data to it and use javacript to improve the usability of an otherwise static site.


### Architecture
The project structure like the one shown below. All files present and the app successfully renders a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser finally no errors displayed in console.

    css

    README.md


### Usability
All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
